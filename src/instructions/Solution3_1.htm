<h1>Solution 3.1 - Race conditions in the producer-consumer problem.</h1>

<h3>Answers to Questions</h3>
<p>You were asked to experiment with different speeds for the producer and the consumer, and 
depending on these speeds you are likely to have observed the following: 
<ol>	
<li><p>When the consumer starts before the producer (or when the consumer is faster than the producer)
 a <code>NullPointerException</code> may occur in the 
<code>Consumer</code>. This is an indication that the consumer has tried to read from a location, before 
any data has been placed there.</p> </li>

<li><p>When the producer is faster than the consumer: the producer has input 
numbers 10 to 29, but the consumer may have only consumed numbers 20 to 29, for 
example. This is an indication that the producer overwrites the data before it 
has had a chance of being consumed: an example of the lost update problem.</p> 

<p>It is also possible that the consumer consumes in an odd order, say from 10, to 19, to 16. 
In that case there are problems in reading the values of the shared variables 
<code>in</code>, <code>out</code> and <code>count</code>.</p></li>
